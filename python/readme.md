# Python Question

Write a python program that takes as input the name of a txt file and creates another file
having the number of occurrences of each word in the original file in descending order. E.g.:


the 563
of 431
to 320
it 210
that 109

Your program should distribute the computation by having 10 worker threads simultaneously
building the resulting list.
